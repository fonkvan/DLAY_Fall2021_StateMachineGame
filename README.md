State Machine Game for first assignment of 437

I wanted to use this assignment as a chance to get better at using C++, so I did this assignment in the entirety of that language. 
I have included a UML diagram which shows the flow of classes, as well as the (story) flowchart. 
This program was written and compiled in Visual Studio 2019, please take that in mind when you are trying to run the program. 
Also note that due to the time spent working on getting the actual nodes to work together, only about half of the story (20 nodes) was able to be written. The other half, 
which is on the right half of the flowchart, was not written. These would be just story nodes, though. Also, there is a class that goes unused in the program, namely the
HealNode class.
